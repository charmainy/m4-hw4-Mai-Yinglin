            <h3>Lover</h3>
            <style>
                h3 {color: #8b0000;text-align: center;}
            </style>
            <img src="photo/lover.jpeg" alt="Lover" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">
            <p>I love Lover for its uplifting themes, romantic storytelling, and musical versatility. The album blends pop, indie, and country influences with heartfelt lyrics about love, self-acceptance, and joy. Songs like Lover and The Archer showcase vulnerability, while ME! and You Need to Calm Down bring fun, empowering energy.</p>

            <h3>Fearless</h3>
            <style>
                h3 {color: #8b0000;text-align: center;}
            </style>
            <img src="photo/fearless.jpg" alt="Fearless" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">
            <p>I love Fearless because it was my first-ever Taylor Swift album, and it perfectly captured the emotions I felt as a teenager. Every song resonates deeply, and I can still remember the lyrics without reading them. To me, this remains the most classic Taylor—timeless, heartfelt, and unforgettable.</p>

            <h3>Reputation</h3>
            <style>
                h3 {color: #8b0000;text-align: center;}
            </style>
            <img src="photo/Reputation.webp" alt="Reputation" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">
            <p>I love Reputation because it’s the album I replay the most in my car. The songs are catchy, bold, and empowering, making every drive feel electric. Its themes of resilience, love, and self-reinvention resonate deeply. Like many fans, I love its mix of edgy beats and emotional depth.</p>
