        <h2>My Top 3 favourite Music Videos</h2>
        <p>Taylor Swift has created numerous music videos, sometimes even stepping in as a director—such incredible talent!<br> 
        Here are my top three favorite music videos. Let me know which one is your favorite! </p>

        <ul>
            <h3>You Belong With Me</h3>
            <style>
                h3 {color: #8b0000;text-align: center;}
            </style>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuNIsY6JdUw">
                <img src="photo/youbelongwithme.jpg" alt="You Belong With Me" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">
            </a>
            <p>You Belong with Me was the first Taylor Swift music video I fell in love with. It beautifully tells the story of a teenage girl crushing on her popular neighbor. I'm not sure how many of you have experienced a similar situation, but I was definitely one of those girls.</p>
        </ul>

    <section>
        <ul>
            <h3>All Too Well</h3>
            <style>
                h3 {color: #8b0000;text-align: center;}
            </style>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tollGa3S0o8">
                <img src="photo/All_Too_Well_short_film_poster.jpg" alt="All too well" style="width: 280px; height:auto;">
            </a>
            <p>All Too Well is Taylor's longest music video, running nearly 15 minutes, with her also serving as the director. It beautifully captures the journey of a relationship—from its sweet beginnings to its heartbreaking end. I absolutely love the storytelling through its cinematography.</p>
        </ul>

    <section>
        <ul>
            <h3>Look What You Made Me Do</h3>
            <style>
                h3 {color: #8b0000;text-align: center;}
            </style>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tmd-ClpJxA">
                <img src="photo/lookwhatyoumakemedo.webp" alt="Look What You Made Me Do" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">
            </a>
            <p>I love Look What You Made Me Do because it's a powerful revenge anthem that showcases Taylor's bold reinvention. The iconic scene of the "Old Taylors" rising from the dead perfectly symbolizes her career evolution. The video's symbolism, hidden Easter eggs, and dramatic visuals make it truly unforgettable.</p>
        </ul>
