            <p> As a longtime fan of Taylor Swift, her music has been with me through countless moments, both joyful and challenging, over the years. As a beginner in coding, I decided to create a simple HTML fan page dedicated to her. I hope you enjoy the content, and I'd love to hear your thoughts!</p>
